# Weather Data Aggregator

## Overview

This project aims to aggregate weather data from multiple weather service providers to generate a more accurate and reliable forecast. By collecting data from various sources and analyzing them, we aim to provide users with a comprehensive overview of the weather conditions.

## Features

- **Data Aggregation**: Collects weather data from multiple weather service providers.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes the collected data to generate a more accurate forecast.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to access weather information.

## How it Works

1. **Data Collection**: The program scrapes weather data from various weather service providers, including [provider1], [provider2], and [provider3].

2. **Data Processing**: The collected data is processed and analyzed to eliminate discrepancies and errors.

3. **Aggregated Forecast**: Based on the processed data, the program generates an aggregated forecast, providing users with a more accurate representation of the weather conditions.

## Usage

To use the Weather Data Aggregator:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (`requirements.txt`).
3. Run the main script (`weather_aggregator.py`) to fetch weather data and generate the forecast.
